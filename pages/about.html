            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a results-driven technology leader with a deep commitment to innovation and excellence. With extensive expertise spanning software development, cybersecurity, and entrepreneurship, I founded my first IT solutions company at the age of 19 to create impactful, technology-driven solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My mission—“Empowering businesses to thrive in a digital world through simplicity, security, and innovation”—reflects my dedication to helping organizations navigate and succeed in the ever-evolving digital landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the course of my journey, I have cultivated robust experience in data analysis, communication strategy, and cybersecurity practices. I remain committed to solving complex problems through straightforward, secure, and effective technology solutions that drive progress and inspire growth.
